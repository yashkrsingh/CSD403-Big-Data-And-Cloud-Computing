# Big-Data-And-Cloud-Computing

This repository contains the programming problems and assignments done in the laboratory under the course CSD403 "Big Data and Cloud Computing".

Every folder contains a Readme file which gives an excerpt of the problem and its solution.

## Assignments

- Clustering (Kmeans)
Implement the k-means clustering algorithm and run the program with different values of k and with progressively larger datasets. Choose the k initial clusters in different ways to get a better perspective on how the k-means algorithm works.

- Association Rule Mining 
Implement the association rule mining algorithm and run your program with different values of the input parameters (support and confidence) and with progressively larger datasets to get a better perspective on how the association rule mining algorithm works.
